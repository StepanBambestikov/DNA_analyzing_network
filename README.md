# DNA_analyzing_network
The prokect is used to create and train neural networks, which predict some thermodynamic parameters of input dna secuence 
The project consists of several modules, modules implement different subtasks:
data_loader - used for load data, taken from the excel file and transform this data in features.
loss - contain several types of custom loss functions using for network training
network_classes - contain several types of network arcitectures
network_manager - contain functions for network training
prediction_analyzer - contain functions and classes for prediction analysis, for example draw distribution of prediction error, or save prediction to some file

model_training_example and model_testing_example shows examples of using modules for network training, saving, loading, and predinction analysis
